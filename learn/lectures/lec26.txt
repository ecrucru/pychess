k In the 19th Century, there was great appeal for this opening. It allowed for immediate attack by White usually by crashing his King Bishop into the f7 Pawn like a Kamikaze.
15
k Today this opening is not always characterized by the same fireworks as our 19th century counterparts. Instead the game is played tending to a more lasting initiative and positional edge.
15
k Many times this opening transposes into other openings, and the beginner often gets confused when book moves are not played. In these cases, I suggest the beginner develop, dig-in, and trade equally before complications can arise.
10
k Cases where this opening is defended with the Two Knights Defense will not be addressed in this lecture, and nor will the Evans Gambit be discussed.

b8c6
f1c4
f8c5
c2c3
k With 4. c3, White aims to build a strong center, preparing for the plan of 5. d4.
12
k The next move by Black develops the character of this game. Generally, the book move Nf6 is the best response. Although other continuations may lead to equality in pieces, their positional merit is unclear.
15

back 1
k Other responses are:
4
k The Quiet continuation 4...d6, the Center-Holding Variation 4...Qe7, and sometimes 4...Qf6.
10
k First, the Quiet continuation.
6
d7d6
k The plan of 5. d4 continues.

k 5...Bb6 costs Black a pawn.

k Another continuation, The Center-Holding Variation.

k With this move Black intends to hold the center. Whether this set-up is ultimately satisfactory remains to be determined. However, If Black trades his King Pawn, the position of the Queen may be compromised.

4
k 7. Nc3 loses a pawn at first, but white's advantage in the center may be greater.
10
k 7. Bd2 ususally ends up in trading Bishops. White avoids a material sacrifice, but the advantage in the center is substantially diminished.

k A wild position. Black is a Pawn to the good, but White has an advantage in development while the position is open. White therefore must depend on energetic play, regardless of the loss of additional pawns or even greater material.
18
