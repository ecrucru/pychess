kib This lecture is intended to show you how to play the Stonewall attack, an age-old white opening that requires little effort to learn and often makes for exciting attacks on the castled black position.
20
Kib Now the disclaimer - This lecture was written by MBDil, a 1500-ish player and a self-proclaimed expert on the stonewall. This lecture is intended for players of up to about 1300 strength, though stronger players may benefit from it.
20
kib Why play the Stonewall? It follows standard opening principles such as control of the center and rapid development. The theory on this opening hasn't changed much in the last hundred years,  so once you learn it, you don't have to spend a lot of time keeping current on theory. It's also very helpful for learning concepts such as pawn storms, strong knights and bad bishops, and sacrificial kingside attacks.
35
kib The stonewall also has minor psychological advantages. Many developing players (<1300) are more comfortable answering e4 than d4.  In addition, the stonewall typically leads to closed positions, which are usually more intimidating for your opponents that may not be familiar with the "full looking" chessboard that often results.
30
kib So that we can see the basic concepts and ideas of the Stonewall, let's first look at a game where black doesn't put up much of a defense.
15
d4
d5
e3
kib This announces your intentions. White chooses to put a bishop on d3 and set up pawns at d4 and f4 to hold the e5 square. The queen bishop is intentionally locked in to allow better movement for the other pieces. It's not a huge drawback. In many cases, it gets to join in the attack anyway.
25
Nf6
Bd3
e6
Nd2
c5
kib Black, wisely, decided to put his queen knight behind his cpawn and also attempts to break up the wall of strong pawns.
kib White doesn't need to worry about cxd, since exd frees his queen bishop without giving up the e5 square.  He does need to be concerned with the c4 push, since it would drive his well-placed bishop off of the b1-h7 diagonal. Thus:
30
c3
kib Then, if black plays c4, white can bring his bishop back to c2
7
c4
Bc2
Nc6
f4
kib White has set up the main pawn structure. He wants to put a knight at e5 to hit deep into black's position and also prevent black from playing e5.
15
Bd6
Ngf3
Ng4
kib This move merely wastes time. It's a one-move threat on the undefended e-pawn.
8
Qe2
kib White doesn't mind playing this move at all... Not only does it defend the pawn, it prepares the queen to swing over to g2 or h2 after the pawns begin storming. It makes room for the rooks to move over as well, and it indirectly supports b2 in the event of a queenside attack by black, which frequently occurs in the Stonewall.
25
Bd7
o-o
Nf6
kib Avoiding O-O?, where white wins a pawn and continues his attack with Bxh7+, and if Kxh7, Ng5+ wins the g4 knight.
18
h3
o-o
g4
kib The storm is afoot! White's plan is to drive the knight from f6 with g5 and pile his forces against the weakened h7 pawn.
13
Qb6
kib Black stumbles onto the correct plan. The idea is a queenside attack, taking advantage of the somewhat cramped white queenside. Better is b5 followed by Qb6.
15
Ne5
kib Its best square. Note that Nxe5 fxe5 forks the bishop and knight. It also opens the f-file and strengthens the attack by white.
10
Nxe5
fxe5
6
back 2
kib Black is also threatened by g5, since moving the knight away will hang the d7 bishop to the knight, which will then fork the Queen and Rook.
15
Qd8
g5
Ne8
kib At this point, the h7 square is weakened and the Queen has freedom to go to h5. Note that an immediate attack is likely to fail, primarily because of the relatively strong pawns in front of the king and the lack of sufficient force to sustain a sacrificial attack.

Kib for instance:

Qh5
g6
Nxg6

kib Threatening mate on h7.
5
fxg6
Nxg6
kib And white will have trouble making progress because the king can slip out of the attack at f7. Black could also organize a strong defense before white's currently dormant pieces could move in to intensify the attack.
20

kib Note that this line wins only if black refuses the free bishop. The extra piece is just too much to fight.

Kg8

kib This is the proverbial nail in the coffin. Qh7 ++ is white's next move.
8
kib You may be thinking now that black put up a lousy defense. This is true. There were many better moves, but the game is instructive in showing the ideal setup of the white pieces during the stonewall attack.
20
kib the attack would not have succeeded without the combination of several white pieces bearing down on the kingside castled position and the huge space advantage held by white.

kib Now we'll look at three other games where the basics ring true although the moves change.

kib White must prevent Ne4. Otherwise, black will almost literally turn the tables and "Stonewall" white.
10
c5
c3
kib The only response. White's dxc is ludicrous, since it gives away control of e5, and gaining e5 is half the point of the stonewall.
12
Nc6

10
f4
kib This prevents it nicely.

Be7
Ngf3
o-o
Ne5
Qc7
o-o
b6
kib White is playing according to plan. He's set up the strong knight at e5 while preventing black from doing the same at e4. He's taken a commanding lead over the b1-h7 diagonal, and has lines open for Qh5 and the rook maneuver R-f3-h3.
20
kib The pawns cover the dark squares of the center and are formidably placed to keep the necessary lines open for attack.
10
kib These are the defining moves of the Stonewall. See why it's so easy to learn?
10
g4
kib Threatening to follow through with the plan to drive the king knight away with g5.
10
Bb7
kib Here, black could actually gain lots of freedom with NxN. For instance:
10
a3
kib The equivalent of doing nothing.
5
Nxe5
fxe5
Ne4
kib The bishop provides enough support to e4 to make this possible. The diagonal is blocked, and black has a strong hold on the center. That's an awful way to end what would have been a strong attack by white.
20
back 4
kib So then what?
6
Qf3
kib Now NxN followed by Ne4 loses a pawn while white's attack is sustained.
10
a6
kib This doesn't look like much, but it's the precursor to a queenside attack by black. Since the kingside couldn't be defended much more than it is, this is probably the correct plan for black.
15
g5
Ne8
Bxh7+
kib When you look at this position, you'll notice the similarity to the previous game in which white had to wait for black to attempt f6 for the bishop sacrifice to work. Why does it work here when it didn't work there?
20
kib The position of black's kingside is identical with the exception of the bishop on e7 instead of d6. White's entire camp is identical to the previous game with the exception of the queen on  f3 instead of e2 and the pawn on h2 instead of h3.
20
kib So how does this work?
10
kib The h-pawn is the key. In this second game, white has the opportunity to bottle up black's kingside and then leisurely play Rf3 and Rh3, with mate to follow.
20
kib This implies that the h3 push in the previous game was premature. Perhaps another action was needed, such as allowing the queen to do the honors of driving the knight away.
15
kib Can you say "Instructive?" Now might be a good time.

20
Nxg6
kib Black has to deal with the attack on his own knight and mate on h8.

kib This brings the queen into the game. Note that the king can no longer slip out via f7 since Rxg7 wins the queen.

15

Be7
kib Black decides not to make the fpawn an issue. Had he played Bd6, Ndf3 would have sufficed, since it clears the way for the c1 bishop to guard f4, though it has the drawback of weakening white's hold on e4. g3 is another possibility, but it has the possible drawback of delaying the 0-0 - Rf3 - Rh3 maneuver until g4 is played.
25
g1f3
b6
Ne5
kib The pattern is there...
Nxe5
kib This is another inaccuracy. White merely has to take with the f-pawn and proceed with a devastating attack that includes the force of the c1 bishop and the open f-file.
15
fxe5
kib A word of advice...  anytime the knight on e5 is taken, it is necessary to take back with the f-pawn. This assures white's control of the kingside by locking up any potential attacks by black along the a7-g1 diagonal and opening the lines for the rook on the f-file and the c1 bishop. It also negates the need for g2-g4-g5, since the e5 pawn is enough to drive away the knight on f6.
